# ABSTRACT
In this work, we measure the excitation of bicep brachialis during elbow flexion in a normal and microgravity environment. The space replicating environment has been created within the constraints of earthen boundary using exoskeletons for upper limb. We plan to validate the results of simulation in an open-source software called OpenSim with data obtained from motion capture of the activity, with the results from a surface EMG sensor physically placed in the bicep muscle region.

We will be able to portray the drastic differences in the muscle activity in normal environment and when subjected to microgravity. The dynamics of motion of the muscle involved will vary between the two environments which will be analysed through OpenSim. The results obtained from both will be compared to prove the effectiveness of using Opensim software for microgravity conditions related to experimental setups in space technology fields as an alternative to conventional techniques.
